# Go Version Policy

NEVER downgrade Go version in `go.mod` or `go.work` files.

## Rules

1. **Do not lower the `go` directive** — if `go.work` says `go 1.25.5`, never change it to `go 1.25.4` or lower
2. **Upgrading is allowed** — increasing version is fine when explicitly requested
3. **Toolchain compatibility** — if linter/tool fails due to version mismatch, suggest running with correct toolchain:
   ```bash
   GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.5 golangci-lint run ./...
   ```

## Why

- Downgrading can break features that depend on newer Go
- The project maintains version parity across all modules
- CI/CD uses the declared Go version

## If Version Conflict Occurs

```bash
# ❌ BAD - never do this
# Changing go 1.25.5 -> go 1.25.4

# ✅ GOOD - use explicit toolchain
GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.5 <command>
```
